## Main Animation

This file contains what is referred to as the 'event model'.  It contains models of the site context, vehicles and characters, all of which were present at the moment of the hard stop.  The models are articulated with armatures and animated to reflect the reconstruction of the movements of the CO19 officers and Mark Duggan as worked out by Forensic Architecture.

Parts of the 3D model can be browsed using 'collections' in the Blender outliner.  For instructions on using the Blender outline, see here: https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/scene_layout/view_layers/introduction.html#outliner

The collection 'Actors' contains 3D models of all persons that were present at the moment of the hard stop.  The sub-collection 'Mark Duggan' contains sub-collections representing the 5 scenarios for the movement of the gun from the minicab to the grass. Including Mark Duggan exiting the minicab and Mark Duggan throwing the gun after the second shot.  These can be toggled by pressing the checkbox next to the colection in the outliner.

The collection 'Vehicles' contains models of all of the vehicles that were involved in the hard stop.

The collection 'Site Context' contains all of the static elements of the surrounding urban environment and pulls data from the file MD_Site Context.blend.

The collection 'Lighting' contains a sunlight which is positioned as it would have been on the day of the hard stop.

The collection 'Cameras' contains all of the animations that were used to make the film produced by Forensic Architecture.

The collection 'Annotation' contains lines and markings which help to illustrate features of the 3D model.  This includes the footsteps as described by professor Derrick Pounder and the areas in which it is most likely that V53 and W42 stood.

The collection 'Probes' contains elements which are used to calculate the reflection seen in wing mirrors and rear view mirrors.

The collection 'Ornaments' contains null objects which are used to control the positions of the limbs of the characters in the scene.
